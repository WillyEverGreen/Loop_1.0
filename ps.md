Automation: Autonomous DevOps & System Reliability Platform
Production systems face 200+ incidents monthly with 4-hour average resolution time. 60% of outages are predictable from monitoring data but detected only after customer impact. Create autonomous DevOps automation that predicts system failures 30-60 minutes in advance using anomaly detection across logs, metrics, and traces, automatically implements corrective actions including service restarts, traffic rerouting, and resource scaling without human intervention, performs intelligent root cause analysis across distributed systems identifying exact failing components and code commits, auto-optimizes database queries and indexes based on execution patterns, manages cloud resources with AI-driven cost optimization shutting down unused instances and rightsizing workloads, implements chaos engineering continuously testing system resilience, and conducts automated deployment with progressive rollouts and instant rollback on error detection. Include ChatOps integration for human oversight and blockchain-based change audit logs. Predict failures with 85% accuracy and 45-minute lead time, reduce MTTR from 4 hours to 15 minutes, false positive rate under 5%, auto-remediation success rate >80%, handle 10 million events per second.
